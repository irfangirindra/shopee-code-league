    "Who doesn't like to search and see these unexpected search suggestion floating just below the search bar. Everyone likes it! As we all know Shopee, one of the largest E-commerce platforms. also has a search bar where users can search for all kinds of item. Shopee wants to build a new search engine. And you are to help Shopee to implement this new engine.\n",

    "# Input\n",
    "Input starts with an integer, denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case will contain two integers N and Q. Here, N is the number of items in the database and Q is the total number of queries. Each of the next N lines will contain an item name as described. Each of the rest Q lines will contain a search query as described. You can safely assume that each item's name will contain at most 10 spaces and the total length will be between 1 to 50.\n",

    "For each case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each query Q print the number of different names in the database who contain the query sequence in their name in exact order."
